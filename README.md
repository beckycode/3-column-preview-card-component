## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When I imported the fonts, I saw the suggestions to add fonts as classes similar to Tailwind, where you focus on utility classes:

```css
.lexend-deca {
  font-family: "Lexend Deca", serif;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
  font-size: 15px;
}
```

When I tried to add the footer I learnt a new way to do it, just setting the `min-height: 100vh` in the body and then in the footer add:
`margin-top:auto`

### Continued development

I did this project previously some years ago and I wanted to compare how I would do it this time, and definitely I've improved a lot.
I'll continue brushing up my skills in CSS.
At the time of this challenge I'm taking an advance CSS course on Udemy.
